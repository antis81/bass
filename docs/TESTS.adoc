== Testing

Since bass has a built in 6502 emulator, you can test your code as part of
the build step.

Basic testing is very simple: Just add `!test` in front of a routine you
want to test:

```asm
    !test
add_xy:
    txa
    stx $2
    clc
    adc $2
    rts
```

This will add a test starting at the given position.

After the assembler has successfully compiled your program, it will run
your tests by just jumping to the indicated position.

Just adding `!test` like this is a great way to make sure you haven't done something
stupid like an infinite loop or jumping into zero memory. But of course it will
be more useful if you add checks:


```asm
    !test X=5,Y=9
add_xy:
    txa
    stx $2
    clc
    adc $2
    !check A == 14
    rts
```

You can also insert arbitrary lua code, and a "virtual" rts intruction for
testing parts your code:


```asm
add_xy:
    txa
    !test
    !run {: mem_write($2, $e9) :}
    ldx $2
    tax
    and #$f
    !check X == 9
    !rts
    stx $4
    nop
    rts
```
